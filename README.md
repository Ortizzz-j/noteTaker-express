# noteTaker-express

## Purpose

 To write down your daily notes and ideas or just something interesting or not interesting that you saw.

## Lesson
 
 Learned how to launch an app using heroku instead of github pages. Feels exciting to learn something new and see a website up and running.

## Motivation

 Got the starter code from class but the motive of the app was to be able to write notes add and delete them. It was interesting seeing how all the files connect together to be able to create something that is visually so simple.
